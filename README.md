# Apprenticeship Backend
The core backend for this product is fairly simple as the main feature is just about apprenticeships. Creating, updating and deleting, which is basically a CRUD application.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Clone the repo and cd to it.
- Install all the dependencies: `npm i`
- Run The server: `npm run dev`

## Run The Tests
The tests heavily depend on the [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite), to get started:
- Install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli) and Login to access the projects.
- Go to the project root dir and Initialize a Firebase Project : `firebase init`, this will generate 2 files `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc`:
    - `firebase.json` configuration file that lists your project configuration.
    - `.firebaserc` file that stores your project aliases.
- Make sure to select the project you created over Firebase Console to add, if you didn't : `firebase use --add` 
- Run the tests: `npm run tests`

Notes:
- Choose ports that don't conflict with the any other running process.
- Make sure to choose: `auth` and `firestore` while selecting the emulator settings.
- ProTip: you can also download the Firebase Emulator UI.
- If you don't want to Initialize a firebase project, you can use the current configs but, you have to edit some properties like `project_id` in `firebase.json`.
- If you faced `'Error while making request: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:9099`, make sure to export as : `export FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST="127.0.0.1:9099"`
- Didn't try to run the tests on windows, but if you face a problem that `export` isn't valid command, change it to `set`.

## The Folder Structure
A good defined architecture is the success key for any application.
If you're familiar with the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern, you may find this one closely similar.

```
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
├── docs // important docs about the project, like the postman files.
│     └── ...
├── src
│   ├── app.js // contains all the app setups for routes, middlewares, and others.
│   ├── server.js // works as an index point for the application.
│   ├── config // contains all the configs for the whole project like db, tests,,, etc.
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── helpers // helper functions that are all around the project, change once in one place
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── middlewares // the layer before the actual execution of the controller.
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── models // all the database schemes and datatypes.
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── modules // the entities of the product.
│   │   └── user
│   │       ├── user.controller.js
│   │       ├── user.routes.js
│   │       ├── user.service.js
│   │       ├── user.tests.js
│   │       └── user.validation.js
│   └── utils
├── tests // testing goes here
│   └── e2e
│   │   └── ...
│   └── unit
│       └── ...
```

As shown above, the structure is so simple as:
- all the source code is in one place `src/` 
- testing modules like e2e and unit testing in `tests/` 
- docs related files in `docs/`

The beauty of the code structure happens in the `src/` dir, as all the product stories' are translated into entities, in the `src/modules` (in our case we have 2+ user and apprenticeship).

Taking a deep dive into the `modules/`:

</p>

1. When a request is being sent to the server, the first thing it hits in the main index is the `index.js/server.js` where the router decides which entityRoute to use.
    
    ```javascript
    // all the user requests like api/v1/user/login will be redirected to the userRoutes
    app.use(`api/v1/user/`, userRoutes)
    ```
2. Then matching happens in the `userRoutes` to check if that route exists and directs to a controller to handle the rest. It's worth mentioning that the controller is the main brain, as it can return the response and throw errors back to the client.

```javascript
import userController from './user.controller'
let router = Router()

// login a user
router.post('/login', userController.loginUser)
```

3. When the controller function related to login is called, some job is done, we can execute the login lines in the same controller but it's a bad practice as:
    - The controller gets really lengthy.
    - Hard to test.
    - Comments of unrelated entities will popup.

```javascript
const loginUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    
    // do the login thing
    const token = await userServices.getLoginToken(req.body)

    res.send({
        success: "logged in :D"
    })
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(e.code || 400).send({
        error : e.message
    })
  }
}
```
4. The service layer, which is responsible for managing the business rules, in our example login.

```javascript
const getLoginToken = async (data) => {
    // do the login related tasks here
}
```

Notes:
- A validation of the incoming data from frontend could be done in the controller: `user.validation.js`
- Implementing tests is plus: `user.tests.js`

## The API Design
Following the REST best practices, we can, for now, sketch some main simple routes based on the user stories.

- POST:  `/api/login/`
- POST:  `/api/forgot-password/`
- GET/POST/PUT: `/api/apprenticeship/`
    - GET by ID: `/api/apprenticeship/{id}`
    - GET all: `/api/apprenticeship/`
    - DELETE: `/api/apprenticeship/{id}`
    - PUT: `/api/apprenticeship/{id}`

## The Database Models

### Firebase
After creating a new project, to get the API key in the project's main page 
* Frontend Api key
    * Gear icon top left(Project overview) --> Project settings --> General --> your apps section --> SDK Setup and Configuration --> Choose your setup type and copy the text

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/apikey_frontend.PNG" width="70%">
</p><br>

* Backend Api key
    * Gear icon top left(Project overview) --> Project settings --> Service accounts --> Generate new private key
    * Move the file to `src/config/firebase-admin-keys.json`

### Cloud Storage
As you can see, we're going all google (which is kinda meh for me tbh), so we're using the google cloud bucket.

To make it work, make sure to go to the project you created on firebase and modify a bucket `*.appspot.com` :
- Get the project id to `.env` as specified in the `.env.example`
- Copy the bucket name to `.env` as specified in the `.env.example`
- Add read permissions for `allUsers`
- Add write permissions for `allAuthorizedUsers`

## Postamn Docs
In the next sprint we'll start documenting the API for the frontend devs.
